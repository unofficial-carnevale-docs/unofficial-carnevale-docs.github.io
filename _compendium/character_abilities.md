## General

Character Abilities are listed on a character's profile, or can be acquired through other means (such as Command Abilities).

Some of these special rules have an (X) listed after them. That (X) is most often a number (such as Fast Swimmer (2) for example), which is referenced in the rule itself. A character may find they are affected by multiple instances of these special rules. **These special rules stack to a maximum of 3 unless otherwise noted.**

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**What's affected by the stacking limit of 3 for Special Rules?** All of the special rules in the Special Rules section that have an (X) after them are subject to this limit. If a character with Expert Offense (2) would gain another instance of Expert Offense (2), that character would end up with Expert Offense (3). If a rule would grant a special rule with an (X) value over 3, only the highest value is used. A character's stats are unaffected by this rule. Multiple rules may stack stats until they reach the limit of 10.

</div>

### Acrobatic (X)

This character may re-roll up to (X) dice when making a DEXTERITY roll as part of any Move/Climb or Jump action.

### Aerial Attack

This character does not lose Life Points from falling, provided it makes a charge from above.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**Can a character with Flight move vertically to gain a charge from above?** Yes, although if it is in base contact with an enemy already it would need to Disengage (and would make an Opposed DEXTERITY roll).

</div>

### Berserk

If this character has 5 or fewer Life Points remaining at the start of its turn, it gains a +1 bonus to its **Action Points** and **+1 ATTACK.**

### Boat Crew

This character may be set up on a Boat at the start of the game. This character replenishes **1 Will Point** at the start of its turn if it is on a Boat.

Additionally, if at least 1 character with the **Boat Crew** ability is currently on a Boat, the *Cast Off Command Ability* only costs **1 Command Point**, and the Boat may instead move up to 18".

### Brave

This character automatically succeeds when making a Basic MIND roll from the **Fear** ability.

### Brawler (X)

This character modifies its ATTACK by (X) when in base contact with **2 or more opponents.**

### Bodyguard (X)

For this special rule, (X) may be a character name or a character with a certain *keyword*.

If an enemy character charges (X), this character may immediately make an out of sequence Run/Climb action provided it is currently out of base contact with any enemy **and** it charges **that** active enemy. This action causes an Attack of Opportunity and takes place **before** the opponent's Attack of Opportunity.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**If 2 characters with Bodyguard are in range of a character that gets charged, can both bodyguards charge the enemy character?** Yes. Each defending Bodyguard can charge the attacker, choose the order in which the defenders will perform their actions, one defender at a time. If the second defender is unable to complete a charge against the attacker, it cannot use its Bodyguard rule.

</div>

### Bulky

This character does not gain any benefit from being in cover, and cannot make **Hide** actions.

### Companion (X)

For this special rule, (X) may be a character name or a character with a certain *keyword*.

If this character can draw line of sight to another (X) character at the start of their turn, they replenish **1 Will Point.**

In addition, while in line of sight to another (X) character they use that character's MIND value instead of their own (even if it is lower). If more than one (X) character is in line of sight, use the highest MIND value.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**If a character has more than one Companion (X) rule, does it gain multiple Will Points back for being in line of sight to both?** No, only one, though you only need to be in line of sight of one (X) character to gain the benefit.

</div>

### Concealment (X)

While in cover this character modifies its PROTECTION by (X).

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>
<p><strong>Does Concealment replace the normal cover modifier?</strong> No, it simply adds or subtracts from it, so a character with Concealment (-1) loses the benefit of cover!</p>
</div>

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Standard barricade cover = +1 PROT (Light Barricade) or +2 PROT (Heavy Barricade). Concealment(X) adds X to that modifier while in cover.

Each Prot die saves 1 LP per Ace (7+, 40%). E[+LP saved per Damage] = X × 0.40.

- Concealment(+1): +0.40 expected LP saved per Damage while in cover
- Concealment(+2): +0.80 expected LP saved per Damage while in cover
- Concealment(−1): removes Light Barricade benefit entirely, reduces Heavy to +1

</div>

### Engage

This character automatically wins the Opposed Roll when an enemy character disengages from them, and so always gets to make an Attack of Opportunity.

If the opposing character has **Slippery** however, then both players roll to disengage as normal.

### Ethereal

This character may ignore all terrain while moving, but cannot end its turn or make any other actions while "inside" Impassable Terrain.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**Do characters with the Ethereal special rule ignore the penalties for water?** Yes.

</div>

### Expert Grappler (X)

This character may re-roll up to (X) dice when making or defending against a **Grapple** or **Drown** action.

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Grapple and Drown both use standard **7+ threshold** (not DEX-dependent).

Re-rolling 1 failed die adds **+0.40** expected Aces. EG(X) = +X × 0.40 expected Aces.

Applies symmetrically when defending, giving the same expected gain on the Opposed Roll.

</div>

### Expert Marksman (X)

This character may re-roll up to (X) dice when making a **Combat** action while **not** in base contact with the target.

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Ranged Combat Attack Roll threshold = target's DEX. Re-rolling 1 failed die:

| Target DEX | P(Ace) | E[+Aces per re-roll] | EM(2) expected gain |
|------------|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 3          | 80%    | +0.80                | +1.60               |
| 4          | 70%    | +0.70                | +1.40               |
| 5          | 60%    | +0.60                | +1.20               |
| 6          | 50%    | +0.50                | +1.00               |
| 7          | 40%    | +0.40                | +0.80               |
| 8          | 30%    | +0.30                | +0.60               |

**Re-roll availability cap.** The `EM(2)` / `E[+Aces per re-roll]` columns assume every re-roll lands on a **failed, re-rollable** die, but two limits apply. (1) You can only re-roll dice that *failed*. (2) The **Destiny die can never be re-rolled**, so the re-rollable pool is only **Attack − 1** dice, not Attack. So usable re-rolls = `E[min(X, failures)]`, where failures ~ Binomial(Attack − 1, 1 − P(Ace)), and gain = usable re-rolls × P(Ace). `X × per-die-rate` is a **ceiling**, approached only when Attack ≫ X.

Worked example at **Attack 4 / DEX 4** (re-rollable = 3 dice, failures ~ Binomial(3, 0.3), mean 0.9):

| Ability  | Naive (X × 0.70) | Actual (Destiny-excluded, availability-capped) |
|----------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| EO/EM(1) | +0.70            | **+0.46**                                      |
| EO/EM(2) | +1.40            | **+0.61**                                      |
| EO/EM(3) | +2.10            | **+0.63**                                      |

The overstatement is largest when X approaches or exceeds Attack − 1 (a 3-die re-rollable pool rarely produces 3 failures, and EO(3) barely beats EO(2)). The cap loosens for high-Attack models. Apply the capped value when scoring offense, not the naive product.

</div>

### Expert Offence (X)

This character may re-roll up to (X) dice when making a **Combat** action while **in base contact** with the target.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>
<p><strong>Can I use Expert Offence on Drowns and Grapples?</strong> No, it is only on Combat actions in base contact.</p>
</div>

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Melee Combat Attack Roll threshold = target's DEX. Same table as Expert Marksman above.

At DEX 4 (very common), **before** the re-roll availability cap: EO(1) = +0.70, EO(2) = +1.40, EO(3) = +2.10 expected Aces. **After** the cap (Destiny die excluded, Attack 4 pool) these fall to **+0.46 / +0.61 / +0.63**. See the note under Expert Marksman.

</div>

### Expert Protection (X)

This character may re-roll up to (X) dice when making a **Protection Roll.**

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Protection Roll uses standard **7+ threshold** (P(Ace) = 0.40 per die). Re-rolling 1 failed die adds **+0.40** expected LP saved.

Same re-roll availability cap as EO/EM applies: only **failed, non-Destiny** Protection dice can be re-rolled, so the re-rollable pool is **Prot − 1** dice and usable re-rolls = `E[min(X, failures)]`, failures ~ Binomial(Prot − 1, 0.60). Naive `X × 0.40` is the ceiling. Example at **Prot 3** (re-rollable = 2 dice, failures ~ Binomial(2, 0.6)): EP(1) ≈ **+0.34**, EP(2) ≈ **+0.48** expected LP saved per Damage (vs naive +0.40 / +0.80). Also capped by incoming Damage: you can't save more than the attack deals.

</div>

### Expert Sorcerer (X)

This character may re-roll up to (X) dice when making a **Cast Spell** action or **Dispelling** a magic spell.

**In addition, this character knows (X) additional magic spells.**

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Spell casting threshold = spell's Difficulty (varies per spell, commonly 6–8).

| Difficulty | P(Ace) | E[+Aces per re-roll] |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| 6          | 50%    | +0.50                |
| 7          | 40%    | +0.40                |
| 8          | 30%    | +0.30                |

ES(1) at Diff 7: +0.40 expected Aces per cast. ES(2): +0.80.

Additional spells known = larger selection at gang-building. Also applies to Dispel rolls (threshold = caster's Mage(X) as MIND-equivalent roll at 7+).

</div>

### Fast Swimmer (X)

If this character starts a **Run/Climb** action **in water,** it adds (X) number of inches to its MOVE for that action (even if it leaves water during the action).

### Fear (X)

When this character makes a **Combat** action, the target must first make a Basic MIND Roll, with their MIND value modified by (X), to a minimum of 1. If they roll **at least 1 Ace** (on a 7+ as normal), there is no effect. But if they roll **no Aces,** this character may re-roll any failed dice rolls for the Combat action.

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Effective MIND = max(1, target MIND + X). P(Fear triggers) = P(no Aces on N dice at 7+) = 0.60^N:

| Eff. MIND | Trigger % |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 60.0%     |
| 2         | 36.0%     |
| 3         | 21.6%     |
| 4         | 13.0%     |
| 5         | 7.8%      |
| 6         | 4.7%      |

When triggered: re-roll ALL failed Combat dice. Each re-rolled failure adds (11 − target DEX) / 10 expected Aces. Fear(0) uses unmodified target MIND. Fear(−1) reduces target's effective MIND by 1 (trigger harder). Fear(−2) at MIND 3 target → eff. MIND 1 → 60% trigger rate.

</div>

### First Strike (X)

This character modifies its ATTACK by (X) when making an **Attack of Opportunity from charging.**

### Flight

When this character makes a Run/Climb action, it may instead **Fly.** Measure from the character to any other point within its MOVE (whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and this doesn't have to be on Solid Ground) and move it without making a DEXTERITY roll. It cannot make any actions while "mid-air" other than further Fly actions, and if it ends its turn "mid-air" it will fall from that spot. Additionally, this character takes 2 less Damage from falling.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>
<p><strong>Can a character with Flight move vertically to gain a charge from above?</strong> Yes, although if it is in base contact with an enemy already it would need to Disengage (and would make an Opposed DEXTERITY roll).</p>
</div>

### Frenzied

This character may use its Life Points as if they were Will Points. Frenzied cannot be used if it would bring a character's life points to 0.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**Do Life Points used as Will Points due to the Frenzied rule count towards the agenda "Will Be Done"?** Yes.

</div>

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Most Frenzied characters have WP 0, making LP their only source of bonus dice.

Two fully boosted attacks (2 LP per attack = 4 LP total):

| Profile        | Base E[Aces/attack] | +2 LP E[Aces/attack] | Gain | LP cost |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|------|---------|
| ATK 3 vs DEX 4 | 2.10                | 3.50                 | +67% | 4 LP    |
| ATK 4 vs DEX 4 | 2.80                | 4.20                 | +50% | 4 LP    |
| ATK 4 vs DEX 5 | 2.40                | 3.60                 | +50% | 4 LP    |

A WP 3 character with no replenishment has 3 bonus dice for the whole game. A Frenzied character at LP 15 has the equivalent of 15 bonus dice available, at the cost of HP attrition: a 5× larger pool, capped at 2 per roll.

With Vampiric Attack(1) on both attacks: recover 2 LP if both connect → net cost drops to 2 LP for a fully boosted double attack. VA(2): potentially net 0 LP cost against low-Prot targets.

</div>

### Hunter

This character gains **Penetration -3** on its weapons (but **not** on Unarmed attacks) when targeting an enemy with a **larger base size.**

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Pen−3 reduces target's effective Prot by 3 on the Protection Roll. Each cancelled Prot die saves 1 LP per Ace (40%). E[+Damage past Protection] = 3 × 0.40 = **+1.2 expected LP** dealt vs a larger-base target. No effect vs Prot 0 targets. Most significant vs Prot 5+ (Prot 6 → effectively Prot 3 when Hunter triggers).

</div>

### Infiltration

This character may be deployed more than 3" above or below ground level at the start of the game, but **not** in water unless specified.

### Limited Movement

This character may only move up to 2" maximum in a single action when in water and up to 2" vertically up or down in a single **Run/Climb** action. They may still Jump as normal.

In addition, this character **cannot** carry Mobile Objectives.

Characters with the Water Creature Special Rule move their full MOVE while in water but still suffer all of the other penalties of Limited Movement.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**Are Jumps affected by Limited Movement?** No.

**Is Disengaging affected by Limited Movement?** No. Disengaging itself is unaffected, though where the disengaging character can move to afterwards is still subject to Limited Movement.

</div>

### Mage (X)

This character is a Mage and knows (X) number of magic spells. See the [Magic](/magic/) section for more details. A character with Mage (0) still knows a single Cantrip.

### Mindless

This character may interact with Objectives as normal (such as carrying, revealing, claiming, or destroying), but is ignored when scoring Victory Points for them at the end of the game. It can still score Victory Points from other win conditions (such as killing enemies or Agendas).

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**Can Mindless characters score Victory Points on scenario Primary Objectives or are only Objectives on the board affected?** Only Objectives on the board are affected, Mindless characters can still score Victory Points through Agendas, killing enemies, or surviving.

**Do characters with the Mindless ability count for taking or contesting Objectives during scoring?** No. Mindless characters are ignored when scoring Objectives.

</div>

### Parry (X)

When this character becomes the target of a Combat action **while in base contact with the attacker,** you may force your opponent to re-roll up to (X) dice from the Attack Roll.

Note that some attackers may choose to re-roll their dice too. In this situation, don't forget that you may never re-roll a dice more than once.

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

The attacker's threshold = this character's DEX. Forcing a re-roll of an Ace:

E[Aces removed per forced re-roll] = P(die fails at threshold DEX d) = (d − 1) / 10:

| Own DEX | Attacker P(Ace) | E[Aces removed per die] |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 3       | 80%             | 0.20                    |
| 4       | 70%             | 0.30                    |
| 5       | 60%             | 0.40                    |
| 6       | 50%             | 0.50                    |
| 7       | 40%             | 0.60                    |
| 8       | 30%             | 0.70                    |

Parry is least effective on low-DEX characters (re-rolled Aces likely succeed again) and most effective on high-DEX characters (each Ace is rare, making each forced re-roll high-value). Attacker with Expert Offence can re-roll the newly failed die. Parry + EO partially cancel.

</div>

### Pickpocket

If this character successfully disengages, its opponent loses 1 Will Point and this character automatically takes any Mobile objective they're carrying.

At the end of the action, this character or any one friendly character within 3" replenishes 1 Will Point.

### Primitive

At the start of this character's turn it must roll a Basic MIND Roll. If it rolls **no Aces,** it receives a Stunned counter.

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

P(Stun | MIND N) = 0.60^N (same formula as Fear trigger):

| MIND | P(Stun) |
|------|---------|
| 1    | 60.0%   |
| 2    | 36.0%   |
| 3    | 21.6%   |
| 4    | 13.0%   |

Stun effect: −1 MOVE/ATK/DEX/MIND (min 1 each) for that turn. In water: +2 LP direct loss at next turn start if counter persists. MIND 1 Primitive chars are severely hampered in most turns. MIND 3–4 is manageable.

</div>

### Slippery

This character automatically wins the Opposed Roll when disengaging, and so never gets hit by an Attack of Opportunity.

If the opposing character has **Engage** however, then both players roll to disengage as normal.

### Universal Shielding (X)

This character always has a minimum PROTECTION of (X), after all modifiers. This special rule can stack higher than 3, but cannot take a character's PROTECTION value above its starting number.

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Effective Prot = min(base\_Prot, max(X, base\_Prot + pen)).

US(X) is active only when a weapon's Pen reduces effective Prot below X. Activation threshold: |pen| > base\_Prot − X.

| US | base\_Prot | pen=−1 | pen=−2     | pen=−3     | pen=−4     |
|----|------------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| 2  | 3          | 2 (-)  | **2** (+1) | **2** (+2) | **2** (+2) |
| 2  | 4          | 3 (-)  | 2 (-)      | **2** (+1) | **2** (+2) |
| 3  | 4          | 3 (-)  | **3** (+1) | **3** (+2) | **3** (+3) |
| 3  | 6          | 5 (-)  | 4 (-)      | 3 (-)      | **3** (+1) |

Bold = US is active. (+N) = Prot dice restored by US. (-) = pen doesn't reduce Prot below X.

E[LP saved per Prot die restored] = 0.40. E.g. US(3) vs Pen−3 on base\_Prot 4: restores 2 dice → **+0.80 expected LP saved per Damage**.

</div>

### Vampiric Attack (X)

If this character makes a **Combat** action while **in base contact** with its target that causes the target to lose at least 1 Life Point, it replenishes (X) of its own Life Points.

<div class="callout">
<p class="callout-title">FAQ</p>

**Can I use Vampiric Attack if I Grapple an enemy off a roof?** No, Vampiric Attack only works on Combat actions in base contact.

</div>

<div class="callout math">
<p class="callout-title">Math</p>

Heals exactly X LP per triggering Combat action (once per action, not per Ace). Trigger requires ≥1 LP lost by target.

P(trigger) = P(≥1 Ace) × P(Prot Roll fails to save all Aces):

- vs Prot 0 targets: P(trigger) ≈ 1 − (1 − P\_ace)^ATK (quickly >90% at ATK 3–4)
- vs Prot 3, DEX 4: reliable at ATK 4+ (multiple Aces expected, saving all unlikely)

VA(2) sustained over 3+ activations can offset significant LP loss (6+ LP recovered). Unreliable vs Prot 5+.

</div>

### Water Creature

This character moves its full MOVE in water, may move up to 8" as part of a Dive action, and cannot be Drowned.

In addition, this character may be set up in water at the start of the game.
