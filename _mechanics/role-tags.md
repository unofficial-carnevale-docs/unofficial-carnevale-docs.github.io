## Why tag models?

To be able to compare models, we tried to give them tags to group them by role. These tags were validated by ensuring their computed capability doesn't sit far from their role's standard.

## Conventions

- **Adjectives** refine a role in parentheses: `Damage Dealer (melee, anti-armour)`, `Canal Fighter (drown)`. They describe sub-role / target-preference, not a separate role.
- **Dual tags** read `A / B`, primary first.

## Roles

### Assassin

Mobile model with the **kill power** to remove a chosen high-value target (an alpha strike).

- **Include:** fast/infiltrating models with the punch to actually kill a key piece.
- **Exclude:** fast models that *can't* reliably kill and exist to tie up/disrupt (Harasser), and fast scorers (Objective Runner).

### Brawler

Aggressive melee with high sustained output and enough bulk to stay in the fight (vs a glass-cannon Damage Dealer).

- **Include:** front-line melee with above-curve EDPA and survivability for its cost.
- **Exclude:** ranged/magic output (Damage Dealer), water-bound melee (Canal Fighter).

### Canal Fighter

Combat effectiveness **tied to water**: fights in/from water (Water Creature and/or Aquatic weapon) or
is slow/weak on land and built for the canals.

- **Include:** Water Creatures, strong amphibians in water-poor factions, Drown/water-control specialists. For Rashaar, as water is the faction baseline, only the standouts are tagged.
- **Exclude:** Fast-Swimmer only models that fight fine on land (water is optional, not defining).
- **Adjective rule:** members from a Damage-Dealer/Brawler origin = clean `Canal Fighter`. Members from any other role carry a function adjective: `(drown)`, `(pull)`, `(grappler)`, `(ranged)`, `(tank)`, `(mage, support)`.

### Control

Hard crowd-control: Stun, Grapple, forced movement, impassable/area denial.

- **Include:** models built to lock down or reposition enemies via abilities/spells.
- **Exclude:** soft mobility-nuisance (Harasser), WP/resource denial (Disruptor).

### Damage Dealer

Primary job is dealing damage. The default offense role.

- **Include:** melee, ranged, or magic dealers. Adjectives carry the flavour: `(melee)`, `(ranged)`, `(magic, <discipline>)`, `(anti-armour)`, `(Stun)`, `(anti-large)`.
- **Exclude:** water-bound dealers (Canal Fighter), long-range Reload shooters whose value is the alpha (Sniper), models that can't reliably kill and exist to annoy (Harasser).
- **Note (mages):** a mage's EDPA assumes its *best damage spells*, meaning they *can* be damage dealers if they take the optimal spells for this role and neglect utility. A [Blood Rites](/magic/blood-rites) mage may take [Bloodlust](/magic/blood-rites#bloodlust) and [Abyssal Mist](/magic/blood-rites#abyssal-mist) and be a support, but as Blood Rites is mainly a damage-dealing discipline they are tagged as Damage Dealers.

### Disruptor

Suppresses the enemy **Will Point economy** by either **lockout** (preventing WP use: "(may) not use Will Points", aura or base contact) or **strip/drain** (removing WP: "loses X WP", WP "wasted").

- **Include:** WP-lockout auras / contact, WP strip-on-hit / drain.
- **Exclude:**
  - *Exploiting* a WP-0 state: bonus damage or re-rolls vs depleted targets (Exorcist's "+3 Dmg vs 0-WP", Thomas Thieme's re-roll). That's a payoff, not denial.
  - *Incidental* WP-strip riders: **Pickpocket** (lose 1 WP on disengage).
  - *Dispel-only / dispel-buff* with no WP denial (Strigoi Jude's Judgement buffs allies' dispel only).
  - *Too situational* denial (Throne, Harlequin: conditional / 50% proc).

### Harasser

A fast model that **disrupts the enemy rather than killing it**: tie up, screen, bait, block, pin the backline/support via mobility and nuisance, with **low kill power** (not an Assassin) and not hard CC (not Control).

- **Include:** fast, cheap/expendable disruptors, often Mindless. An **expensive** model qualifies only if it harasses with **high efficiency**. Adjective `(aquatic)` for a water-based harasser.
- **Exclude:** real killers, pure scorers/pickpockets (Objective Runner), hard-CC (Control), too-fragile bait pieces, models whose primary role is resource/support,
  models too slow to harass, defensive disengage tricks that aren't enemy nuisance (e.g. Confusing Exit).

### Line Fighter

Rank-and-file frontline melee, holds your line, moderate output, not an elite dealer.

- **Include:** vanilla frontline combatants between Brawler and cheap filler.
- **Exclude:** a Line Fighter whose EDPA exceeds the Damage Dealer median is arguably a dealer.

### Objective Runner

Fast/mobile model whose job is to grab, contest, and score objectives, including Pickpocket theft (steal WP + objectives on disengage).

- **Include:** mobile scorers and pickpocket thieves whose primary value is theft/scoring.
- **Exclude:** Mindless models (can't score Primary Objectives). If fast + low-output they lean Harasser. Fast killers (Assassin).

### Sniper

Long-range shooter with high single-shot **alpha**, Reload-gated, low sustained EDPA by design (range and burst are the trade). Scored on alpha, not EDPA.

- **Include:** dedicated long-range gunners.
- **Exclude:** rapid shooters that sustain fire (Damage Dealer (ranged)).
- **Note (range):** Ranged models have their range as adjectives. As Snipers should be long-ranged, an 8-12" Sniper is tagged (low-range) whereas Damage Dealers would be tagged (mid-range).

### Specialist

Catch-all for unique-mechanic models that fit no standard role.

- **Include:** Mask-givers, spawners/summoners, gondola/transport, adaptive/copy models, Emissary tentacles, Artifact carriers, Destiny-Die control, and other irreplaceable niche tech.
- **Exclude:** anything that fits other tags.

### Support

Buffs, heals, or enables allies: mages (buff/heal disciplines), auras, Companions, WP batteries.

- **Include:** dedicated enablers and WP-battery / Nexus-style models. A support mage tagged Support whose EDPA exceeds the Damage Dealer median is still Support if it would spend its slots on buffs/heals.
- **Exclude:** models that actively deny *enemy* resources (Disruptor).

### Tank

High-survivability models with a way to protect allies or to annoy opponents.

- **Include:** durable blockers, Bodyguards, high-Protection/Shielding anchors with modest offense.
- **Exclude:** durable models whose *point* is output (Brawler) or water (Canal Fighter). A Tank with ATK2K below ~80% of the Tank median is a "soft tank".
