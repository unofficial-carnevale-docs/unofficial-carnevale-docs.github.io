## Units and method

Unit: [**EDPA**](/mechanics/combat/) (Expected Damage Per AP, in Life Points).

The headline EDPA is **sustained, and Reload-aware**:
The model fires its best weapon up to its Reload cap over its full AP, then falls back to the next-best weapon, so a single-shot gun's per-AP throughput is roughly halved. The **alpha** column is the best *single-action* EDPA (the burst on the turn it does fire). For snipers, weight alpha for the kill turn and EDPA for sustained pressure. All cold (no WP, no Frenzy LP), best of weapons / accessible damage spells, vs the balanced reference (Dex 4 / Prot 3).

See [Combat Capabilities Calculations](/mechanics/combat/) for method and calibration, and [Role Tags](/mechanics/role-tags/) for tags explanations.

## Role profiles vs defenders

Median EDPA per role vs each reference defender, showing what each role is good against and where its output collapses. The `balanced` column (Dex 4 / Prot 3) is each role's headline EDPA. **Raw** EDPA is the absolute / threshold lens. The per-Ducat table follows: since raw EDPA largely tracks cost (e.g. Brawler median 3.25 > Damage Dealer 2.92, but per-Ducat both sit at ~0.19), only the per-Ducat view compares roles fairly across rows.

| Role | balanced | soft | evasive | armoured | pen_proof_tank | parry |

## Alpha vs sustained

Some roles are judged on their single-shot **alpha**, not sustained EDPA, because Reload caps how often they fire. These two views isolate that gap.

### Snipers

A Sniper fires one Reload-limited shot per turn from range, its value is the single-shot **alpha**, not sustained throughput (so it is *not* counted in the Damage Dealer pool). Sniper standard: median alpha **3.74**, median alpha/Ducat **0.234**. A sniper below the alpha/Ducat median is weak even for its cost.

| Model | Faction | cost | alpha | sustained | alpha/Ducat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Naval Lieutenant](/factions/patricians/naval-lieutenant/) | [Patricians](/factions/patricians/) | 15 | 5.08 | 2.54 | 0.339 |
| [Scorpio Marksman](/factions/the-vatican/scorpio-marksman/) | [The Vatican](/factions/the-vatican/) | 15 | 4.87 | 2.44 | 0.325 |
| [Baroni](/factions/the-guild/baroni/) | [The Guild](/factions/the-guild/) | 15 | 4.83 | 2.41 | 0.322 |

| [Maltese Squire](/factions/the-vatican/maltese-squire/) | [The Vatican](/factions/the-vatican/) | 10 | 1.5 | 0.75 | 0.15 |
| [Arbalest](/factions/the-guild/arbalest/) | [The Guild](/factions/the-guild/) | 10 | 1.5 | 0.75 | 0.15 |

### Burst over sustained

Models whose single-shot **alpha** far exceeds their **sustained** EDPA, from one of two causes: a **Reload-capped weapon** (guns and artillery that fire once per round, e.g. Spirit Cannon, Bomb, Electron Cannon) or a **once-per-round damage spell** (the Wild Magic casters here burst with a single strong Summon Vermin, the Drowned Nun with Dagonite Baptism). High alpha means strong on the turn they fire, low sustained means poor turn over turn. Cost-efficiency below uses sustained, so these rank lower than their burst suggests.

| Model | Faction | Role | alpha | sustained | drop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Naval Lieutenant](/factions/patricians/naval-lieutenant/) | [Patricians](/factions/patricians/) | Sniper | 5.08 | 2.54 | 2.54 |

## By faction

Faction-level offence: output quality against the global standard, plus the two annotation layers (Frenzy and WP) that lift factions above their cold EDPA.

### Output quality

Per-faction median EDPA for each primary offensive role, vs that role's global median (Snipers are judged separately on alpha, above). ***vs global (value)* (per-Ducat) is the fairer read**. The raw column favours factions whose models are simply more expensive.

**Small-n roles (1-2 models) are effectively a single statline, not a distribution.**

**Damage Dealers** (global median EDPA 2.92, EDPA/Ducat 0.19):

### Frenzy burst

EDPA above is **cold** (no WP, no Frenzy). Frenzied models spend LP as bonus dice (2 LP per fully-boosted attack) for a one-off burst. This is the layer that explains why a faction can sit below the cold standard yet hit far harder in practice. Burst = median best-melee EDPA vs balanced with +2 LP-dice. Cost = 2 LP per boosted attack.

| Faction | n dealers/asn/brl | Frenzied | median cold EDPA | median burst EDPA | burst uplift |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Gifted](/factions/gifted/) | 13 | 0 (0%) | 2.68 | - | - |
| [Patricians](/factions/patricians/) | 14 | 2 (14%) | 2.9 | 4.22 | +59% |
| [Rashaar](/factions/rashaar/) | 16 | 0 (0%) | 2.83 | - | - |
| [Strigoi](/factions/strigoi/) | 17 | 14 (82%) | 3.09 | 4.33 | +48% |
| [The Doctors](/factions/the-doctors/) | 22 | 1 (5%) | 2.73 | 2.41 | +113% |
| [The Guild](/factions/the-guild/) | 15 | 0 (0%) | 3.38 | - | - |
| [The Vatican](/factions/the-vatican/) | 16 | 4 (25%) | 3.27 | 4.26 | +45% |

### WP-boost

Cold EDPA excludes WP. Spending up to 2 WP on a roll adds dice (~+50% raw Aces on a full boost). This shows each faction's offensive models that can boost from their **own** WP pool, the resulting boosted attack, and how rich the faction's WP economy is, the layer that lifts WP-rich factions above the cold standard. Boost = best single attack with up to +2 dice (capped by the model's own WP pool), uplift vs cold alpha.

| Faction | WP economy | offensive models w/ own WP | median boosted atk | median uplift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [The Vatican](/factions/the-vatican/) | Highest (most WP-rich) | 15/18 (83%) | 4.63 | +48% |
| [Patricians](/factions/patricians/) | High (combat rewards + Sopracomito battery) | 17/17 (100%) | 4.08 | +38% |
| [The Doctors](/factions/the-doctors/) | High (Nexus pool sharing) | 9/15 (60%) | 4.12 | +53% |
| [Gifted](/factions/gifted/) | Situational (most models self-fund) | 12/13 (92%) | 4.08 | +50% |
| [The Guild](/factions/the-guild/) | Medium (many small sources) | 13/15 (87%) | 4.29 | +45% |
| [Rashaar](/factions/rashaar/) | Medium (Soul Drain, close-range) | 7/7 (100%) | 4.31 | +32% |
| [Strigoi](/factions/strigoi/) | Low (uses Frenzy/LP instead) | 3/13 (23%) | 4.06 | +52% |

### Most cost-efficient (EDPA/Ducat, cost ≥ 6)
