## Core Rules

- Spend up to **2 WP** before any roll: each WP = +1 die
- **WP does not replenish per round** (unlike AP): a model with WP N has exactly N bonus dice for the entire game unless it has a replenishment source
- Per-roll cap (2) and total pool (N) are independent: WP 2 = 2 bonus dice total, usable as +2 on one roll or +1 on two rolls

---

## TLDR: What WP is worth (best to worst)

- **On an attack:** the best use. More dice = more hits and more damage. Fully boosting a key attack
  can lift its damage by roughly half.
- **On casting a spell:** very good: it makes an important spell much more likely to land (and avoids
  disastrous fumbles).
- **On a defence (Protection) roll:** okay, but worth less than on an attack.
- **On a movement or utility roll:** small and rarely worth it.

## Detailed maths: Value per WP by Action Type

### Combat / Ranged Attack (threshold: target DEX)

Each bonus die adds **(11 − DEX) / 10** expected damage. WP is most efficient here because DEX is usually below 7.

| Target DEX | E[+Aces per WP] |
|------------|-----------------|
| 4          | +0.70           |
| 5          | +0.60           |
| 6          | +0.50           |
| 7          | +0.40           |

Full +2 WP on ATK 4 vs DEX 4: 2.80 → 4.20 expected Aces (**+50% damage**).

### Protection (threshold: 7+)

Each bonus die adds **+0.40** expected LP saved.

| PROT | Base E[LP saved] | +1 WP | +2 WP |
|------|------------------|-------|-------|
| 3    | 1.20             | 1.60  | 2.00  |
| 4    | 1.60             | 2.00  | 2.40  |

WP on defence is worth less per point than on offence vs DEX 4–5 targets.

### Grapple / Drown (threshold: 7+)

Each bonus die adds **+0.40** expected Aces. Lower return than melee Combat vs low-DEX targets, mainly used to secure a Critical (Stun) or avoid a Fumble.

| ATK | Base | +1 WP | +2 WP |
|-----|------|-------|-------|
| 3   | 1.20 | 1.60  | 2.00  |
| 4   | 1.60 | 2.00  | 2.40  |

### Jump (Basic DEX Roll, threshold: 7+)

Each bonus die adds **+0.40 expected inches** (Success = 2" + 1" per Ace).

| DEX | Base move | +1 WP | +2 WP |
|-----|-----------|-------|-------|
| 3   | 3.2"      | 3.6"  | 4.0"  |
| 4   | 3.6"      | 4.0"  | 4.4"  |
| 5   | 4.0"      | 4.4"  | 4.8"  |

### Magic (threshold: spell Difficulty)

WP serves two roles: **casting cost** (1 WP per spell) and **dice boost** (up to 2 additional WP on the roll). These are separate spends.

| MIND 3, Diff 7 | P(Success) | P(Fumble) | E[Aces] |
|----------------|------------|-----------|---------|
| No bonus dice  | 78.4%      | 3.6%      | 1.20    |
| +1 WP dice     | 87.0%      | 2.2%      | 1.60    |
| +2 WP dice     | 92.2%      | 1.3%      | 2.00    |

+2 WP halves the fail rate and nearly triples Critical potential. Fumble costs a Stun counter **and** −1 extra WP, making near-empty pools a downward spiral.

---

## Frenzied: The LP-as-WP Engine

Most Frenzied characters have WP 0, so LP is their only bonus-die source. A LP 15 character has **15 bonus dice** total, about 5× a typical WP 3 non-mage, capped at 2 per roll.

### Two fully boosted attacks in one turn (4 LP cost)

| Profile | Base E[Aces] | +2 LP E[Aces] | Gain | LP cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ATK 3 vs DEX 4 | 2.10 | 3.50 | +67% | 4 LP |
| ATK 4 vs DEX 4 | 2.80 | 4.20 | +50% | 4 LP |
| ATK 4 vs DEX 5 | 2.40 | 3.60 | +50% | 4 LP |

Very few non-Frenzied models can match this output. WP 4 is rare outside dedicated mages, and spending it all on two attacks leaves nothing for the rest of the game.

### Vampiric Attack interaction

Each triggering hit refunds X LP. With VA(1) on two boosted attacks:

- Spend 4 LP, recover 2 LP if both connect → **net 2 LP** for a +50% damage turn
- With VA(2): net 0 LP cost against low-Prot targets

### LP attrition risk

| LP pool | 4 LP cost (1 boosted turn) | % of pool |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 12      | 4 LP                      | 33%       |
| 15      | 4 LP                      | 27%       |
| 19      | 4 LP                      | 21%       |
