## Units and method

Metric: [**ATK2K**](/mechanics/combat/) (Attacks-To-Kill = LP ÷ expected net LP lost per incoming attack).

This is the EHP-equivalent survivability number, folding LP, Dexterity, Protection, Parry, and Universal Shielding. Higher means tankier. The baseline uses the baseline reference attacker (Attack 3). `net_*` means expected LP lost per attack from each reference attacker.

See [Combat Capabilities Calculations](/mechanics/combat/) for method and calibration.

## Role standards

Median ATK2K per role vs each reference attacker, how many hits of each type a role survives (higher is tankier). **Raw** is the absolute lens; the per-Ducat table follows, and since raw tracks cost only the per-Ducat view compares roles fairly across rows.

**Drown excludes Water Creatures** (immune), so its column reflects only the models a Drown can target.

| Role | baseline | elite | penetrator | drown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tank | 23.7 | 5.85 | 9.65 | 8.0 |
| Brawler | 21.0 | 5.5 | 12.4 | 9.0 |
| Control | 12.65 | 4.25 | 6.9 | 7.4 |
| Canal Fighter | 12.55 | 4.1 | 6.55 | 5.8 |
| Disruptor | 12.25 | 3.95 | 8.9 | 7.3 |
| Sniper | 11.5 | 3.8 | 6.3 | 6.9 |
| Damage Dealer | 10.75 | 3.7 | 6.3 | 7.7 |
| Assassin | 10.3 | 3.7 | 6.55 | 8.35 |
| Line Fighter | 9.7 | 3.3 | 5.0 | 5.8 |
| Specialist | 9.7 | 3.3 | 5.0 | 5.8 |
| Support | 9.7 | 3.3 | 5.3 | 5.8 |
| Harasser | 8.75 | 3.15 | 5.2 | 5.8 |
| Objective Runner | 7.7 | 2.85 | 4.85 | 5.3 |

### Per Ducat

Median ATK2K/Ducat vs each attacker, the fair cross-role comparison.

| Role | baseline | elite | penetrator | drown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tank | 1.532 | 0.384 | 0.593 | 0.56 |
| Brawler | 1.318 | 0.371 | 0.711 | 0.6 |
| Sniper | 0.993 | 0.293 | 0.525 | 0.525 |
| Line Fighter | 0.974 | 0.329 | 0.506 | 0.58 |
| Disruptor | 0.824 | 0.275 | 0.584 | 0.481 |
| Canal Fighter | 0.797 | 0.261 | 0.45 | 0.55 |
| Objective Runner | 0.787 | 0.279 | 0.505 | 0.482 |
| Harasser | 0.757 | 0.292 | 0.487 | 0.52 |
| Support | 0.752 | 0.254 | 0.417 | 0.438 |
| Damage Dealer | 0.72 | 0.254 | 0.427 | 0.519 |
| Specialist | 0.694 | 0.25 | 0.418 | 0.442 |

| Assassin | 0.587 | 0.224 | 0.397 | 0.475 |

## By faction

Per-faction median ATK2K within each combat role, vs that role's global median, which strips out the role-mix confound of an overall faction average. Support, Specialists, and Objective Runners are excluded, durability is not their job. **`vs global (value)` (per-Ducat) is the fairer read**; the raw column favours factions whose models are simply more expensive.

**Small-n roles (1-2 models per faction) are effectively a single statline.**
