### ⚠ Faction and model pages are auto-generated

`_factions/` and `_models/` are produced by a separate data pipeline and should not be edited directly — changes will be overwritten on the next publish run. To update faction or model content, edit the pipeline sources instead.

## Contributing

Pull requests for rules corrections, errata updates, or compendium improvements are welcome. For anything in `_factions/` or `_models/`, open an issue describing the change rather than editing the files directly.
